#STEAM, getting it to work with free ATI driver
 (# remove appcache after every update to get steam to launch, might help sometime)
rm -Rf ~/.steam/steam/appcache
 # apparently I can just do this if I know graphics driver is loaded properly:
    #!/bin/bash
    export LD_PRELOAD='/usr/$LIB/libstdc++.so.6' #Export so all child processes are affected as well
    export DISPLAY=:0
    #export LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose
    steam
 # but this is the long version:
    #1 running steam shows it can't open radeonsi_dri.so
    #2 verify driver is working -> direct rendering: Yes
        DISPLAY=:0 glxinfo | grep -i direct
    #3 open Steam in verbose mode to diagnose -> can't find required LibC6 version
        DISPLAY=:0 LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose steam
    #4 check which version behind libstdc++.so.6 -> gives steam's version
        ls -l /home/macaroot/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/i386/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
    #5 check which version is in /usr/lib -> gives driver's version (there is also one in lib32)
        ls -l /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6
            # was ls -l /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 in tutorial but I didn't have i386-linux-gnu direct
    #6 tell steam to load the latest libstdc++.so.6 from both lib and lib32 as necessary, use this to run Steam
